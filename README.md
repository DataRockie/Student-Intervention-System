# Student-Intervention-System
##What I did
Predict how likely a student is to pass their exam using classification.  Tested 3 different classifiers on the data(Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines). Used Grid Search &amp; F1 score to tune most optimal classifier obtained.

##What I have Learnt
From this unit of the Nanodegree program and project, I learned about the various classification algorithms that are used for Machine Learning. By analysis of multiple classifiers on the dataset, I was able to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various classifier algorithms. I reinforced my current understanding by performing model fitting, data preperation, and using the F1 score to optimize classifier parameters alongside grid search.
Things I learned from this project:

The strengths and weaknesses of various Machine Learning classifiers (e.g. Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM, etc)
General applications of multiple Machine Learning classifiers (Spam Detection, Student Intervention, etc.)
Evaluating performance of various ML classifiers to find the best model for the situation (training time, testing time, F1 scores, etc.)
Reinforced concepts learned such as model fitting, data preperation, splitting into training & testing sets, and model tuning.
